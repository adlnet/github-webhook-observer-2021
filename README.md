# 2021 Webhook Observer

This server monitors Github webhooks and rebuilds project containers when new commits are made to their corresponding codebases. 

It's designed around docker-compose projects and utilizes some of docker-compose's configuration to rebuild only the necessary comtainers that received changes.

The webhook should be set to send PUSH notifications only.

## TL;DR

- `git clone https://github.com/adlnet/github-webhook-observer-2021 webhooks`
- `cd webhooks`
- `sudo ./install.sh`
- `cp sample.env`
- Populate `.env` file (see below)
- `sudo pm2 start watch.js`

## Installation

For installation, we deploy this with PM2 and recommend that approach, but it technically only requires NodeJS and NPM.  An install script `install.sh` is included and will handle the NodeJS + NPM versioning on Linux:
```
git clone https://github.com/adlnet/github-webhook-observer-2021 webhooks
cd webhooks
sudo ./install.sh
cp sample.env .env
```

## Config

The observer needs a little configuration to work properly.  These settings are handled through a typical `.env` file, with a `sample.env` included as a starting point.

|Property|Example|Description|
|-|-|-|
|REPO|`../my-project`|Relative path to the repo being observed.|
|WEBHOOK_SECRET|`some-long-secret`|The webhook secret being used in the GitHub Webhook settings|
|PORT|`8000`|The port being used by the observer|
|REBUILD_COMMAND|`docker-compose up -d --build`|Seldom-used command that will be triggered if all containers need to be rebuilt.|

but the project does support CLI arguments if that's more your style:
```
node watch.js [path/to/project/folder] [github-webhook-secret] [port] [rebuild.sh]

arguments:

[path/to/project/folder] - Required. This is from the point of the .js file, 
        so if the observer and target folders are in the same directory then it would
        look like. "../targert-project-folder".

[github-webhook-secret] - Required. This is the secret set in the github webhook settings.

[port] - Optional. The default is 8000.

[rebuild.sh] - Optional. name of Bash script to rebuild project. Expected in project root directory. 
               The default is 'rebuild.sh'
```


## Running

To start the observer, we'll create a PM2 process and have that handle everything.
```
sudo pm2 start watch.js
```

This will ensure that the observer persists through machine restarts and whatnot.  More information on PM2 can be found **[here](https://pm2.keymetrics.io/docs/usage/quick-start/)**.
